        Supercharged Tic Tac Toe
This modification for the classic Tic Tac Toe game expands the board and adds a second goal after the original goal of lining three pieces up. It hopefully adds some more depth and excitement into the original without overcomplicating it with too many rules and significant changes to the base mechanics.
- 2 Players
- 6x6 Board
Goal:
Have the most links from supercharged pieces when the board is filled at the end of the game.

        This is a 2 player cooperative card game focused on managing to remain in the game for 9 rounds. The gameplay consists of each player placing down cards that are within a given range of each other, and this range depends on what round it is. The range decreases every couple of rounds, making it harder to stay in the game and gather points. Points are cards from the main deck pile, and will allow the game to continue once this pile runs out.
This game layer is meant to emulate the thematic layer of maintaining connections or relationships through distance, over time, and through hard situations. It tries to take a simple concept, placing down cards that work with each other, and inserts an increasingly difficult dilemma into this pattern. It also presents different ways to make more points depending on certain combinations of cards such as duplicates and Jokers. In addition, placing Jokers allows either receiving the corresponding points or purchasing tokens, a resource that facilitates the desired “connection” between players.
